## Acceptance Criteria Checklist

- [ ] All 7 scanners fully implemented
- [ ] Unit test coverage >80%
- [ ] E2E scenario: scan â†’ preview â†’ quarantine â†’ restore
- [ ] Circular scan button with progress ring
- [ ] Multi-step confirmation for destructive ops
- [ ] Quarantine and restore working
- [ ] Whitelist/blacklist UI functional
- [ ] Protected paths never deleted
- [ ] Audit log records all operations
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline passes
- [ ] Demo video recorded
- [ ] Documentation complete

## Next Immediate Actions

1. âœ… Read existing scanner implementations to understand patterns
2. Complete MailAttachmentsScanner implementation
3. Complete LargeOldFilesScanner implementation
4. Complete PrivacyScanner implementation
5. Create SpeedScanner from scratch
6. Add circular progress ring to scan button
7. Create comprehensive confirmation modals
8. Set up testing infrastructure
9. Write unit tests for each scanner
10. Create E2E test scenario

## Success Metrics

- âœ… `npm test` passes all tests
- âœ… Dry-run scan completes without errors
- âœ… Restore operation returns file with matching checksum
- âœ… UI is responsive and accessible
- âœ… Memory usage stays under 500MB during scans
- âœ… Demo video shows complete workflow
