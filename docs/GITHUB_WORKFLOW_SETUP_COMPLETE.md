## 🔄 How It Works

### On Every Push to `main` or `develop`

```
Push → GitHub Actions → Build & Test → Artifacts Saved (7 days)
```

**Actions taken:**
- Install dependencies
- Run linter
- Build main process
- Build renderer process
- Test on Ubuntu, macOS, Windows
- Save build artifacts

### On Tag Push (e.g., `v1.0.1`)

```
Tag Push → GitHub Actions → Build → Package → Release → Update README
```

**Actions taken:**
1. **Build Job**: Same as regular push
2. **Release Job**:
   - Build for macOS (Intel + Apple Silicon)
   - Build for Windows (x64 + x86)
   - Build for Linux (AppImage, deb, rpm)
   - Create installers (.dmg, .exe, .AppImage, etc.)
   - Create GitHub Release
   - Upload all installers
3. **Update README Job**:
   - Auto-update download links
   - Update version numbers
   - Commit changes back
4. **Create Manifest Job**:
   - Create `latest.json` for auto-updates
   - Upload to release

## 🚀 How to Create Your First Release

### Method 1: Using the Script (Easiest)

```bash
cd /Users/ekd/Documents/coding_env/multi/ekdclean
./scripts/release.sh 1.0.0
```

**The script will:**
1. Ask for confirmation
2. Update package.json
3. Update README links
4. Commit changes
5. Create tag
6. Push everything
7. Show you the Actions URL to monitor

### Method 2: Manual Steps

```bash
# 1. Update version
npm version 1.0.0 --no-git-tag-version

# 2. Update README (manually edit download links)
# Change v0.0.0 to v1.0.0 in download section

# 3. Commit
git add package.json package-lock.json README.md
git commit -m "chore: bump version to 1.0.0"

# 4. Tag and push
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0"
git push origin main
git push origin v1.0.0
```

git commit -m "feat: Complete color/theme system fixes

- Fixed logger undefined issue

## 🔧 Workflow Customization

### Want to change build settings?

Edit `.github/workflows/build-and-release.yml`

### Want different platforms?

Edit `package.json` → `build` section

### Want to change release notes?

Edit `scripts/release.sh` → Tag message section

---

## 💡 Tips & Tricks

### Test workflow without releasing
```bash
# Push to develop branch
git checkout -b develop
git push origin develop
```
This will build but not create a release.

### Create pre-release versions
```bash
./scripts/release.sh 1.0.0-beta.1
```

### Skip specific platforms
Edit workflow file and comment out matrix entries.

### Debug build issues
Check the Actions logs - they show all commands executed.
